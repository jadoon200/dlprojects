# dlprojects â€” Reinforcement Learning

This branch focuses on reinforcement learning experiments, with a primary project on training Deep Q-Network (DQN) variants to solve the Pendulum environment.

## Contents
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Full implementation and training workflow
- **GIF Visualisations**: Animated rollouts showing agent performance across different configurations
- **Model Weights**: Saved trained models for reproducibility

## Highlights
- Implementations of baseline DQN and advanced variants (Double DQN, Dueling DQN, Dueling + Noisy Nets)
- Comparative experiments with different action discretisations
- Visual performance analysis using generated GIFs
