# dlprojects

A collection of deep learning experiments and projects, exploring various architectures and applications.

Each branch contains its own dedicated work, including:
- Source code(ipynb) for the specific model or task
- Training results and evaluations
- Visualisations such as graphs and performance GIFs

For example, the `reinforcement_learning` branch showcases a Deep Q-Network (DQN) implementation on the Pendulum environment, complete with trained weights and animated rollouts.
